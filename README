1. Use "make" to compile and use "make clean" to clean. The executebale file is named "RACIPE" as default.

2. Run the package:
  1> De novo run by using .topo file:
    $ ./RACIPE *.topo [options]
    RACIPE preprocesses the topology information (in .topo file) and generate two files:
    - .cfg file storing all setting for simulation (can be used in the second way to run the package);
    - .prs file storing the range to do randomiztion of parameters.

  2> run by using .cfg file
    $ ./RACIPE *.cfg [options]
    In this way, .prs file is needed in the same folder. To change the setting of the simulation, you can either change the .cfg file or use options. 

3. Options
-h             : Show all available options 

-dist          : Distribution used for randomization (only use with .topo file);
                 1 ---> Uniform Distribution (Default);
                 2 ---> Guassian Distribution;
                 3 ---> Exponential Distribution;
-SF            : Scale the distribution ranges of parameters except hill coefficients, usually smaller than 1 (Default 1) (only use with .topo file);
-num_findT     : Number of simulaitons used to estimate threshold (Default 1000) (only use with .topo file);
-flag          : Only produce .cfg file or not (Default 0, not only produce .cfg file) (only use with .topo file);

-num_paras     : Number of RACIPE models to generate (Default 100);
-num_ode       : Number of Random initial values to solve ODEs (Default 100);
-num_stability : Maximum number of stable states to save for one RACIPE model (Default 10); 
-thrd          : Cutoff for convergence of steady states for numerically solving ODEs (Default 1.0);
-Toggle_f_p    : Save parameters of each RACIPE model or not (Default 1 (yes));
-stepsize      : Stepsize for solving ODE (Default 0.1);
-maxiters      : Maximum of Iteration for solving ODE at each RIVs (Default 20);
-Toggle_T_test : Test threshold assumption or not (Default 1 (yes));
-KDID          : Gene or link (See their ID in .cfg file) to be knockdown (Default 0);

4. Input file
  1> .topo file
     Format of topology file:
     Sourse  Target  Type
     ...     ...     ...

     Types of regualtions: 1 --> Activation; 2 --> Inhibition;

  2> .cfg file, generated by the package via de novo run.

5. Output file
  1> .cfg and .prs file generated by de novo run;
  
  2> _parameter.dat storing the parameters of each RACIPE model
     Format of _parameter.dat:
     Model_index Average_iterations_for_convergence Number_of_stable_states Parameters_of_model

     Average_iterations_for_convergence : for each set of random initial values used to solve the ODEs, the expected iterations needed for the convergence of the ODEs.
     number_of_stable_states            : Number of stable steady state of the RACIPE model.
     Parameters_of_model                : See .prs file for which parameter each column stands for.

  3> _solution_.dat storing the gene expression for each stable steady state in log2 scale.
     The models with different number of stable states are stored in different files, e.g. monostable models are stored in _solution_1.dat.
     Format of _solution_.dat:
     Model_index Average_iterations_for_convergence Number_of_stable_states Solutions

     Solutions               : See .cfg file for which gene each column stands for.

  4> _T_test.dat storing the test of threshold assumption for each RACIPE model.
     Format of _T_test.dat:
     Model_index Over_threshold_A Below_threshold_A ... 

     Over_threshold_A  : Number of stable states for current RACIPE model whose expression of gene A is larger than the threshold parameter of A.
     Below_threshold_A : Number of stable states for current RACIPE model whose expression of gene A is smaller than the threshold parameter of A.
